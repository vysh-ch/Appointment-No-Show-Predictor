# No-Show Prediction System for Medical Appointments

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict patient no-shows for medical appointments. It combines feature engineering, predictive modeling, intervention strategies, and schedule optimization to help healthcare providers reduce missed appointments.

## Overview

Missed appointments (no-shows) cause inefficiencies and increased costs in healthcare systems. This system uses historical appointment data to predict the likelihood of a no-show, recommend intervention strategies, and suggest schedule optimizations to mitigate risk.

---

## Features

* **Feature Engineering**: Processes raw data into useful features like days until appointment, patient no-show rate, weather risk, etc.
* **Predictive Model**: Trains an XGBoost classifier to estimate no-show probabilities.
* **Intervention Strategies**: Suggests reminders and assistance based on risk level.
* **Scheduling Optimization**: Proposes earlier appointment slots for high-risk patients.
* **Pipeline Integration**: Combines all components in an easy-to-use interface.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Install required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost
   ```

---

## Usage

Run the main script to simulate the pipeline with sample appointment data:

```bash
python no_show_prediction_system.py
```

The script will output:

* No-show probabilities and recommended interventions per appointment.
* Scheduling recommendations for high-risk patients.

## Classes and Modules

### FeatureEngineer

* Converts dates and extracts temporal features.
* Encodes categorical variables.
* Computes patient history statistics.
* Applies feature scaling.

### NoShowPredictor

* Wraps an XGBoost classifier.
* Provides methods for training, prediction, and evaluation.

### InterventionManager

* Maps predicted risk to a set of intervention strategies (SMS, calls, transportation assistance).

### ScheduleOptimizer

* Adjusts appointment times for patients with high no-show risk.

### NoShowPredictionSystem

* Orchestrates data processing, model training, prediction, intervention assignment, and scheduling optimization.

## Example

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Create sample data
sample_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'patient_id': range(100),
    'appointment_date': [datetime.now() + timedelta(days=i%30) for i in range(100)],
    'booking_date': [datetime.now() - timedelta(days=i%14) for i in range(100)],
    'age': np.random.randint(18, 80, 100),
    'patient_gender': np.random.choice(['M', 'F'], 100),
    'appointment_type': np.random.choice(['checkup', 'follow-up', 'specialist'], 100),
    'weather_condition': np.random.choice(['clear', 'cloudy', 'rain', 'snow'], 100),
    'no_show': np.random.choice([0, 1], 100, p=[0.8, 0.2])
})

# Initialize system and run
system = NoShowPredictionSystem()
results, schedule_recommendations = system.process_appointments(sample_data)

print(results[['patient_id', 'no_show_probability', 'interventions']].head())
print(schedule_recommendations.head())
```
